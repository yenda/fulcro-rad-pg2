= fulcro-rad-pg2

A PostgreSQL plugin for Fulcro RAD using the pg2 driver.

This is a PostgreSQL-only adapter optimized for performance using the native pg2 driver.
For multi-database support (H2, MariaDB, MySQL), see the original `fulcro-rad-sql` project.

== Configuration

In order to use the pg2 plugin you must configure connection pools.

The general layout of a config (which commonly includes `config/defaults.edn` on your classpath) should include:

[source,clojure]
-----
...
 :com.fulcrologic.rad.database-adapters.pg2/databases
   {:main {:pg2/schema :production}}
...
-----

The primary keys in the databases section are database names.
You may have any number of databases in your application.
Each database uses a schema name, which defines which attributes in your model belong in that database.

This allows you to do things like create more than one database with the same schema and shard users across them.

=== Database Connection Pools

This library uses the pg2 PostgreSQL driver for connection pooling.

[source,clojure]
-----
(ns com.example.components.connection-pools
  (:require
    [mount.core :refer [defstate]]
    [com.fulcrologic.rad.database-adapters.pg2.driver :as pg2]
    [pg.pool :as pg.pool]))

(def pg2-config
  {:host "localhost"
   :port 5432
   :user "user"
   :password "password"
   :database "mydb"})

(defstate connection-pools
  :start
  {:production (pg2/create-pool! pg2-config)}
  :stop
  (pg2/stop-connection-pools! connection-pools))
-----

The configuration options for the pg2 adapter look like this:

[source]
-----
 :com.fulcrologic.rad.database-adapters.pg2/databases
   {:main {:pg2/config {:host "localhost"
                        :port 5432
                        :user "myuser"
                        :password "mypassword"
                        :database "mydb"}
           :pg2/pool {:pool-min-size 2
                      :pool-max-size 10}
           :pg2/auto-create-missing? true
           :pg2/schema :production}}
-----

=== Schema Generation

Automatic schema is quite nice for early development work, and is enabled with the `auto-create-missing?` flag.

Each database should be given an (invented) schema name, which will match the schema you set on (some or all) attributes.

The automatic schema generation just tries to generate columns in tables if (and only if) they do not already exist.
This is reasonable for really fast startup of a project, but is almost certainly insufficient for real projects.

For production use, manage your schema with a migration tool of your choice (e.g., Flyway, Migratus, or plain SQL scripts).
The `com.fulcrologic.rad.database-adapters.pg2.migration/automatic-schema` function can generate DDL statements
that you can use as a starting point for your migrations

== Attributes

RAD attributes that will be used in a PostgreSQL database can be configured as follows (where the pg2 namespace is `com.fulcrologic.rad.database-adapters.pg2`):

`::attr/schema`:: (required) A keyword that matches the schema you want to store the attribute on.
`::attr/identities`:: (required on non-identity attributes) A set of keyword (names) of the id attributes
that identify tables for which this attribute is a row.
`::pg2/column-name`:: (optional) A string to use to override the automatic column name.
`::pg2/table-name`:: (optional, but only on identity attributes) A string. Overrides the table name that goes
with a given identity attribute.

== Resolvers and Save Middleware [[Resolvers]]

The library supports generation of batched Pathom3 resolvers that can run queries against PostgreSQL tables.

There is also save middleware that handles form saves via the pg2 adapter.

=== Save Middleware

[source,clojure]
-----
(ns com.example.components.save-middleware
  (:require
    [com.fulcrologic.rad.database-adapters.pg2.plugin :as pg2-plugin]))

(def middleware
  (-> (pg2-plugin/wrap-pg2-save)
      ;; add other middleware here
      ))
-----

=== pg2 Resolvers

[source,clojure]
-----
(ns com.example.components.auto-resolvers
  (:require
    [com.example.model :refer [all-attributes]]
    [mount.core :refer [defstate]]
    [com.fulcrologic.rad.resolvers :as res]
    [com.fulcrologic.rad.database-adapters.pg2.read :as pg2-read]))

(defstate automatic-resolvers
  :start
  (vec
    (concat
      ;; custom resolvers that are declared on attributes
      (res/generate-resolvers all-attributes)
      ;; pg2 resolvers for PostgreSQL
      (pg2-read/generate-resolvers all-attributes :production))))
-----

If you have more than one schema, simply call `pg2-read/generate-resolvers` once for each schema.
It returns a sequence of resolvers that can be installed into your parser.

== The Parser

The central element of the entire back-end is the Pathom Parser. Give the above definitions it will look
something like this:

[source,clojure]
-----
(ns com.example.components.parser
  (:require
    [com.example.components.auto-resolvers :refer [automatic-resolvers]]
    [com.example.components.config :refer [config]]
    [com.example.components.connection-pools :as pools]
    [com.fulcrologic.rad.database-adapters.pg2.plugin :as pg2]
    [com.fulcrologic.rad.pathom :as pathom]
    [com.fulcrologic.rad.form :as form]
    [com.fulcrologic.rad.blob :as blob]
    [com.example.components.blob-store :as bs]
    [com.example.components.save-middleware :as save]
    [com.example.components.delete-middleware :as delete]
    [mount.core :refer [defstate]]
    [com.example.model :refer [all-attributes]]
    [com.example.model.account :as account]
    [com.example.model.timezone :as timezone]
    [com.fulcrologic.rad.attributes :as rad.attr]
    [com.example.model.invoice :as invoice]))

(defstate parser
  :start
  (pathom/new-parser config
    [(rad.attr/pathom-plugin all-attributes)
     (form/pathom-plugin save/middleware delete/middleware)
     (pg2/pathom-plugin (fn [_] {:production (:main pools/connection-pools)}) config)]
    [automatic-resolvers
     form/resolvers
     ...]))
